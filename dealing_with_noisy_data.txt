A)Noise in tabular data can be of three types:
  1.Anomalies in certain data items (Noise 1: certain anomalies in features & target)
    > either remove the outliers records or put upper and lower ceiling.
    >use Density-based anomaly detection( kNN & LOF based methods),Clustering-based anomaly detection(k-Means clustering),
     Autoencoder-based anomaly detection or using visualisation.
  2.Features that don’t help in explaining the target (Noise 2: irrelevant/weak features)
    >use feature selection methods like Forward selection,Backward elimination,Recursive elimination,Embedded Methods, chi-square & pearson
  3.Records which don’t follow the form or relation which rest of the records do (Noise 3: noisy records)
    >use cross-validation,look at the cross validation score of each fold and analyse the folds which have poor CV scores, what are the 
     common attributes of records having poor scores, etc.

B)Benefits of identifying & treating noise in data:
  1.enables the DS algorithm to train faster.
  2.reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret
  3.improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen
  4.reduces overfitting
