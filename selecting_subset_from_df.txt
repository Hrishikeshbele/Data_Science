pro-tips:
>When selecting multiple columns, you can select them in any order that you choose. It doesnâ€™t have to be the same order 
as the original DataFrame.

1.df['food']: selecting single column of dataframe
2.df[['color', 'food', 'score']]: select multiple column
3.df.loc['Niko':'Dean']:returns rows starting from label niko upto and including dean
