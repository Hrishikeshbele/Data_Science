Type of Naive Bayes Algorithm:Python's Scikitlearn gives the user access to the following 3 Naive Bayes models.
# from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB
1.Gaussian
The gaussian NB Alogorithm assumes all contnuous features (predictors) and all follow a Gaussian (Normal Distribution).

2.Multinomial
Multinomial NB is suited for discrete data that have frequencies and counts. Spam Filtering and Text/Document Classification are two 
very well-known use cases.

3.Bernoulli
Bernoulli is similar to Multinomial except it is for boolean/binary features. Like the multinomial method it can be used for spam filtering 
and document classification in which binary terms (i.e. word occurrence in a document represented with True or False).
