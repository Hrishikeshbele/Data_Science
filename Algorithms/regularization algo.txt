1.Ridge Regression:
This model solves a regression model where the loss function is the linear least squares function and regularization is given by 
the l2-norm. 
ex.1. clf = Ridge(alpha=1.0,solver='auto', random_state=None) # aplpha is regularization parameter
   2. Ridge regression with built-in cross-validation:
      ridgecv = RidgeCV(alphas=(0.1, 1.0, 10.0), cv=None, scoring='mean_squared_error') #default cv is Generalized Cross-Validation
