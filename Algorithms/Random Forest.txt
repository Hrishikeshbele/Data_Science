'''
we built each decision tree in random forest with:
1.using bootstrap samplled dataset(selecting subset of rows using bootstrap sampling)
2.only considering random subset of atributes at each step while splitting the node 
3.finally we use majority voting to predict the outcome of random forest
> step 1+2+3 is called bagging 
'''
1.feature importances attribute using random forest model:
ex.
# extract feature importances, convert into a Series
importances = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=X.columns)
