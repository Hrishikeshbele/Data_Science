1. Normalization rescales the values into a range of [0,1]. This might be useful in some cases where all parameters need to have the same 
positive scale. 
Xchanged= X−Xmin/Xmax−Xmin

2.Standardization rescales data to have a mean (μ) of 0 and standard deviation (σ) of 1 (unit variance).
Xchanged=X−μ/σ
For most applications standardization is recommended.
