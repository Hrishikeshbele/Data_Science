1.random.random(): gives you a random floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0) (so including 0.0, but not including 1.0 which is 
also known as a semi-open range).

2.random.uniform(a, b): gives you a random floating point number in the range [a, b].

3.random.seed(10):Seed function is used to save the state of random function, so that it can generate some random numbers on multiple 
execution of the code on the same machine or on different machines (for a specific seed value).if you provide same seed value before 
generating random data it will produce the same data.
