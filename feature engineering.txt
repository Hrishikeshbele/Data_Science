goals:
  1.Preparing the proper input dataset, compatible with the machine learning algorithm requirements.
  2.Improving the performance of machine learning models.
  
1.Feature Split:
By extracting the utilizable parts of a column into new features:We enable machine learning algorithms to comprehend them,Improve model    performance by uncovering potential information.Split function is a good option, however, there is no one way of splitting features.
example:
data.name
0  Luther N. Gonzalez
1    Charles M. Young
2        Terry Lawson
3       Kristen White
4      Thomas Logsdon
#Extracting first names
data.name.str.split(" ").map(lambda x: x[0])
0     Luther
1    Charles
2      Terry
3    Kristen
4     Thomas
#Extracting last names
data.name.str.split(" ").map(lambda x: x[-1])
0    Gonzalez
1       Young
2      Lawson
3       White
4     Logsdon
