> derivative is rate of change of function value(y) w.r.t x .
> slope of function can be different at different point on funtion graph.
> vectorization makes python code much faster than traditional for loop.
> try to avoid rank 1 array data str while coding in python use n*m vectors instead.
> we rarely use the "math" library in deep learning because the inputs of the functions are real numbers. In deep learning we mostly use matrices and vectors.
