1.Machine learning uses only numeric values (float or int data type). However, data sets often contain the object data type 
 that needs to be transformed into numeric data type.
 >one of the way to adress this is to use One Hot Encoder:
  from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
  onehotencoder = OneHotEncoder(categorical_features = [0])
  X = onehotencoder.fit_transform(X).toarray()
