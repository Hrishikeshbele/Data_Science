>Seaborn makes our charts and plots look engaging and enables some of the common data visualization needs (like mapping color to a variable
  or using faceting).
>There are essentially a couple of (big) limitations in matplotlib that Seaborn fixes:
1.Seaborn comes with a large number of high-level interfaces and customized themes that matplotlib lacks as it’s not easy to 
  figure out the settings that make plots attractive
2.Matplotlib functions don’t work well with dataframes, whereas seaborn does

1)Scatterplot using Seaborn:
Ex:
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.relplot(x="TID", y="Price",hue = "Property Type", data = df_train)
  
2)Jitter Plot:Jitter is the deviation from the true value.
ex:
  sns.catplot(x="education", y="avg_training_score", hue = "is_promoted", data=df2)
  
3)Boxplot using seaborn:
  >when use hue semantic with boxplot, it is leveled along the categorical axis so they don’t overlap.it creates box plot for each type in    hue column.
ex:
  1.sns.catplot(x="education", y="avg_training_score", kind = "box", data=df2)
  2.sns.boxplot('default', 'balance', data=df, orient='v', ax=ax2, palette=c_palette) 
  #orientation- horizontal(h)/vertical('v') ,palette-Colors to use for the different levels of the hue variable
  
4)seaborn.regplot():Plot data and a linear regression model fit.
ex.sns.regplot(x, y ,ax=ax1, order=1, scatter_kws={'color':'r'})  #scatter_kws gives red color to data points, ax- Axes object to draw the plot onto, otherwise uses the current Axes.
  
  
5) pair plot:
ex. sns.pairplot(df)

6.distplot:Flexibly plot a univariate distribution of observations.
ex. sns.distplot(train['ApplicantIncome'])
