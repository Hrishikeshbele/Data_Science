1.parametric learning algorithm learns parameters from training data which are fit to data.once we have fitted parameters we no longer 
need to keep the training data around to make future predictions.A parametric algorithm has a fixed number of parameters. A parametric 
algorithm is computationally faster .
ex.linear regression,logistic regression, linear Support Vector Machines

2. a non-parametric algorithm uses a flexible number of parameters, and the number of parameters often grows as it learns from more data.  
A non-parametric algorithm is computationally slower, but makes fewer assumptions about the data.to make predictions using non-parametric 
algorithm, we need to keep the entire training set around.in nonparametric models, the complexity of the model grows with the number of 
training data.
>non-parametric does not mean that they have NO parameters! :)
ex.K-nearest neighbour,decision trees, RBF kernel SVMs
